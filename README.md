# R murder mystery
There's been a Murder in R City! The R Murder Mystery is designed to be
both a lesson to learn R concepts and commands and a fun game for R
users to solve an intriguing crime. The mystery is directly based on
[The SQL Murder Mystery](https://mystery.knightlab.com), which again was
inspired by [a crime in the neighboring Terminal
City](https://github.com/veltman/clmystery).

To solve the mystery one must use various R functions and methods.
